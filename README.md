# Action Validate Image

"Validate" is a custom GitHub Action made by Enterprise Contract that validates container images for security and compliance. It performs a three-stage validation process:

1. **Signature Verification:** Checks if the image is signed and verifies the signature with a provided public key.

2. **Attestation Verification:** Ensures the image has signed and valid attestations, providing additional information about its source.

3. **Policy Conformance Verification:** Verifies that the image's attestations comply with defined policies, ensuring adherence to organizational standards.
